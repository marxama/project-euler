=============

Solutions to some of the problems on <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>. I've been a fan of the page for a long time, though I haven't done very much lately. Thought I ought to take it up again, so I've re-done some of the problems, and solved some new ones. Most of my old stuff is gone forever, but that's a good excuse to ensure you're only getting old, not stupid!
